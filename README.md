üß† Project Description:

This project includes a series of JavaScript problem-solving tasks completed in 4 days.
Each day focuses on a different part of Basic JavaScript, such as math operations, conditions, objects, and arrays.
All tasks are organized into separate folders, with 15 problems per day.

üß© Topics Covered:

  1. Day : Basic Math Operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus)
  2. Day : Conditional Statements (if, else if, switch, comparison, and logical operators)
  3. Day : Objects (creating, accessing, updating, and looping through objects)
  4. Day : Arrays (methods like push, pop, slice, splice, and iteration using loops)

‚öôÔ∏è Challenges Faced:

  - Finding the best logic for each problem
  - Debugging and fixing small errors in conditions
  - Handling nested objects and arrays
  - Keeping the folder and file structure clean
  - Staying consistent with naming and code style

üéØ Finishing & Outcome:

Completed 60 JavaScript problems in total ‚Äî 15 for each day.
This small project really helped me understand JS logic better,
and improved my problem-solving and coding habits a lot
